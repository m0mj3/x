                        Hey! I'm Jos, I'm a Canadian (yes, I like playing hockey üèí)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm 17 and live, precisely, in Toronto, Canada. I have a lot of passions, mainly being a gamer or developer (sometimes they're the same :D). 
                        I like making friends and it's passion of mine to help out people around me! I was adopted into Canada.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm constantly learning, and take every opportunity to learn and expand on things that I work on. 
                        I usually push the limits of what is asked of me, and that helps me learn and in turn adds more to the project I am working on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm really hyper, and quite energetic. Sometimes it's a good thing, and sometimes a bad thing. 
                        Personally though, I like to acknowledge my faults and utilize my hyperness to fix those faults, or just improve on my strengths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. 
                        I‚Äôm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By utilizing said energy and hyperness, I can channel it into dedication to what I do. 
                        Projects I work on, even if I'm juggling many at once, equally get attention and my full effort as I pursue them. 
                        I push the limits of not only my own ability, but how I can make the experience for those whom are going to use what I make. 
                        This drive makes me not only better as a developer, but also as a person to work with and be around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>In terms of development</b>, I have experience in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, HTML + CSS, Go, and Jet-Lang. While I have done front-end for websites
                        in the past, I've deviated towards back-end development as a DevOps Engineer as well as a backend developer in general as a passion and focus.
                        I work with Minecraft Plugin Development often, custom coding and also just general configuration. I have a large amount of experience in system adminstration
                        and devOps, working with platforms such as Teleport and Pterodactyl as well as OSs like Ubuntu and CentOS almost on the daily. I spend a lot of time working in a team,
                        making me experienced in working with others to achieve project goals as well as forming connections to help expand horizons and build my skills off of others.
                        I work with many clients which give me insight into many different fields scaling with each client's needs and requests. Making me not only better as a developer, but as person as well.
                        I try my best to be positive, even if others are extremely negative, giving me an uplifting personality to encourage people to keep going, even in the worst case scenarios developement as well as life-wise.
